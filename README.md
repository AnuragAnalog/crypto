# Cryptography

This repo contains some algorithms for encryption and decryption of some famous
cryptographic methods.

## Vigenere:

   This directory contains algorithms of encryption and decryption of vigenere cipher.

* There also methods for estimating the length of the key and a rough estimation of the key.
   Friedmen vigenere gives a estimate of the key length.

## ROT13

   This directory contains algorithm for encrypting and decrypting of plain text using rot13 method.

* It takes a letter a replaces it with the 13th letter from that position.

* The algorithm for encrypting the plain text and decrypting the cipher both are same.

* It is a form of ceaser cipher with a shift equal to 13.

> ROT stands for Rotate by 13 places
